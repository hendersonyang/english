## Adding Logic
You can now add logic to your programs with if conditions.

#### Writing the program
```
x is true
if x do log "Hello!"
else do log "Bye!"
```
"if" checks if the statement provided is true, if it's true it runs the code after "do"
After any IF statement a ELSE statement can be added which runs the code after "do" if the intial "if" is false.
"log" is the universal function for writing data to console. All data within the double quotes following will be written to the console.

#### Running the program
```
english run main.es
```
#### Conclusion
If you see "Hello!" when setting x to true, and "Bye!" when setting x to false , congrats! You just added logic to your E# program.
