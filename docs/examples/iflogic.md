## Adding Logic
You can now add logic to your programs with if conditions.

#### Writing the program
```
x is true
if x do log "Hello!"
else do log "Bye!"
```
"if" checks if the statement provided is true, if it's true it runs the code after "do"<br>
After any IF statement a ELSE statement can be added which runs the code after "do" if the intial "if" is false.<br>
"log" is the universal function for writing data to console. All data within the double quotes following will be written to the console.<br<

#### Running the program
```
english run main.es
```
#### Conclusion
If you see "Hello!" when setting x to true, and "Bye!" when setting x to false , congrats! You just added logic to your E# program.
