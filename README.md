# English
The world's first natural language programming language.

## Why switch to English?
### Horrible Syntax
See and understand the horrible programs you write!
```
x is 5
if x is greaterthan 10 do log "Big!"
else if x is greaterthan 100 and x is lessthan 10 do log "Very Big!"
else do log "Small!"
```
### Efficient 
| Language      | Time to create average program |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| English | 10 minutes |
| Javascript | 50 hours       |
| Python | 200 hours        |
| Rust | .005 hours |
### Compressable for production
```
x:5~if~x~:>10~do~log~"Big!"~elif~x:>100&x:<~do~log~"Very Big!"~else~do~log~"Small!"
```
Average build time: Over 8,000 years
